I am a second year [ELLIS Ph.D.](https://ellis.eu/) at [TU Darmstadt](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fb20/index.en.jsp) 
at the [UKP Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) at TU Darmstadt, Germany and the University of Cambridge, UK.
I am supervised by [Prof. Iryna Gurevych](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t3A39e8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Anna Korhonen](https://sites.google.com/site/annakorhonen/).

I obtained my undergraduate and master's degrees (University of Toronto ML Group) from the University of Toronto, and my master's research was under the supervision of Prof. Brendan Frey ([PSI Lab](https://psi.toronto.edu/)).

I have been working in the industry for many years in the domain of NLP before I went back to school. 
I worked at Canadian start-ups like Meta (acquired by CZI), Wattpad (acquired by NAVER), and ElementAI.

I have research interests in both NLP and ML. 
I am interested in efficient methods that help with multi-lingual transfers and the utilization of multi-modal information [P5, P6, P7]. 
I also study and create datasets for figurative expressions [P4]. 
Last but not least, I use the perspective of distribution shifts/OOD generalization [P6, P7] to tackle problems in multi-lingual transfers and the utilization of multi-modal information. 

You can contact me if youâ€™re interested in collaborating or just chat about research, start-ups, anything.
