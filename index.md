I am a second year [ELLIS Ph.D.](https://ellis.eu/) at [TU Darmstadt](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fb20/index.en.jsp) ([UKP Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp)), Germany and the University of Cambridge, UK.
I am supervised by [Prof. Iryna Gurevych](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t3A39e8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Anna Korhonen](https://sites.google.com/site/annakorhonen/). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of NLP and ML. 
I am interested in efficient methods that help with cross-lingual transfers and the utilization of multi-modal information [[P5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06379), [P6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07630), [P7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05487)]. 
In particular, I use the perspective of distribution shifts/out-of-distribution generalization [P6, P7, P9] to tackle problems in those areas. 
I also study and create datasets sometimes. 

Previously, I studied at the University of Toronto, where I obtained both of my undergraduate and master's degrees. My master's research was under the supervision of Prof. Brendan Frey ([PSI Lab](https://psi.toronto.edu/), Toronto ML Group). I have been working in the industry for nearly a decade in the domain of NLP before I went back to school. 
I worked at Canadian start-ups like Meta (acquired by CZI), Wattpad (acquired by NAVER), and ElementAI.
