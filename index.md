Hihi 👋, I'm Cecilia. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at [LTL](https://ltl.mmll.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge.

My research interests are:
 1. Cultural adaptation and alignment (for example: [CLCA](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.156/)), 
   particularly leveraging ideas from social learning or in multi-agent setups.
   Additionally, I am interested in cultural evaluations in situated social contexts.
 2. Efficient and low-resource methods for multilingual NLP (an example: [FUN](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-long.111/)).
 3. Methods and analyses of models inspired by developmental psychology, neuroscience, or social psychology.
 4. Applications in education, healthcare, psychotherapy, and the creative industries, emphasizing multilinguality and cultural adaptation (an example: [CultureCare](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07902)).

I appreciate pure deep learning methods, but I'm equally drawn to ideas for NLP grounded in theories and insights from other disciplines, 
such as sociology, anthropology ... maybe a bit too broad for my own good.

Here are some of the works that I've done during my PhD, and I am still very interested in these ideas:
 * Cross-lingual generalization (e.g., plasticity, spurious correlations etc. [P7](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-long.111/), [P9](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15210))
 * Culturally aware and adapted NLP ([P8](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-long.112/), [P10](https://aclanthology.org/2025.tacl-1.31/))
 * Multimodality ([P4](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.476/), [P6](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-eacl.186/))

Previously, I was doing my PhD at [TU Darmstadt](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fb20/index.en.jsp) ([UKP Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp)), Germany.
Prior to returning to research, I spent nearly a decade in industry working in the field of NLP.
Earlier, I studied at the University of Toronto (BASc and MASc, [PSI Lab](https://psi.toronto.edu/)).
