I am a third year [ELLIS Ph.D.](https://ellis.eu/) at [TU Darmstadt](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fb20/index.en.jsp) ([UKP Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp)), Germany and the University of Cambridge, UK.
I am supervised by [Prof. Iryna Gurevych](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=t3A39e8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Anna Korhonen](https://sites.google.com/site/annakorhonen/). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of NLP and ML.
Specifically, I am interested in:
 * Cross-lingual generalization (e.g., plasticity, early period of training, memorization vs generalization, spurious correlations etc. [P6](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-eacl.186/), [P7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05487), [P9](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15210))
 * Culturally aware and adapted NLP ([P8](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-long.112/), [P10](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03930), [P11](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02953))
 * Multimodality ([P4](https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.476/), [P5](https://aclanthology.org/2023.repl4nlp-1.9/), [P6](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-eacl.186/)) 

Previously, I studied at the University of Toronto, where I obtained both of my undergraduate and master's degrees. My master's research was under the supervision of Prof. Brendan Frey ([PSI Lab](https://psi.toronto.edu/), Toronto ML Group). I have been working in the industry for nearly a decade in the domain of NLP before I went back to school. 
I worked at Canadian start-ups like Meta (acquired by CZI), Wattpad (acquired by NAVER WEBTOON), and ElementAI.

I'm also keen to engage more with cognitive science and neuroscience =)
